# Coffee Sales Analysis Report

## Analysis Results and Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Sales Analysis
**Findings**
Sales peak during mid-January to March, likely driven by colder weather. Conversely, sales drop significantly during the summer months.

**Recommendations**
Winter Strategy: Introduce promotions like "Buy One, Get One Free" or launch seasonal latte menus to boost winter sales. Highlight comforting and warm beverages such as flavored lattes or hot mochas.

Summer Strategy: Counter the seasonal dip by promoting refreshing options such as iced coffees, cold brews, and innovative offerings like coffee slushies.

### 2. Coffee Sales by Type
**Findings**
Execlsa beans lead in total sales and have been consistently popular, though showing signs of declining interest. Meanwhile, Arabica and Liberica beans have gained traction, with Robusta maintaining steady performance.

**Recommendations**
Leverage the growing popularity of Arabica and Liberica by introducing new blends or signature drinks featuring these beans.

Develop and market unique blends incorporating Robusta to revitalize interest in lesser-promoted varieties.

### 3. Coffee Sales by Country
**Findings**
The United States is the dominant market, accounting for the largest share of sales.

**Recommendations**
Capitalize on the U.S. market potential by implementing region-specific promotions and advertising campaigns.

Explore opportunities for digital marketing and loyalty programs tailored to U.S. customers to further drive engagement and sales.

### 4. Most Profitable Products
**Findings**
Liberica beans (e.g., product codes L-L-2.5 and L-M-2.5) rank among the most profitable items. Certain Execlsa products also exhibit high profitability margins.

**Recommendations**
Focus promotional efforts on high-profit items to maximize revenue.

Highlight these products in marketing campaigns, bundle offers, and loyalty rewards to increase visibility and drive sales.
